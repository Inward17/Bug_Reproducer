You previously generated the following Selenium script:

--- PREVIOUS SCRIPT ---
{previous_script}

It failed with the following structured result:

--- FAILURE FEEDBACK ---
{failure_json}

Attempt history (do not repeat these mistakes):
{history_summary}

Instructions:
1. Explain in 1-2 sentences what went wrong.
2. Explain your fix in 1-2 sentences.
3. Output the corrected Python script — NOTHING ELSE after the script. No markdown fences.

Apply all original rules: WebDriverWait only, print REPRODUCED on success,
screenshot in except, driver.quit() in finally.
